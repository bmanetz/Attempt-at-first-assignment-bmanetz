# Example List
- Item 1
- Item 2
- Bananas
- Rod of Cesium-137
- Strange 6-dimensional Riemann Disc
## How to Use
- The rod of Cesium will emit a gamma particle. When this particle enters the Riemann disc, the disc solves for the 4 x 4 imaginary matrix of the gamma photon. Many beginners mess this part up, and it's a really important setup for the next part.
- MAKE SURE YOUR BANANA IS PROPERLY CALIBRATED. We don't enjoy stray emissions of antimatter, especially here. You're gonna wanna ask a trusted adult for help on this one.
- Align the antiphoton component of your matrix with the banana. A beta emission from radioactive potassium will occur, and interact with the antiphoton. You have two antiparticles now.
- Item 1 and Item 2 don't have to be perfectly raw, but assume of 95% blend of itemness. If you get this part wrong, there's still room for improvement but it's not the end of the world.
- Enjoy an explosion that forms a rift in spacetime.
