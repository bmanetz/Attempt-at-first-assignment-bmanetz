# List of Items
- Item 1
- Item 2
- Bananas
- Rod of Cesium-137
- Strange 6-dimensional Riemann disc
## Directions
- The Cesium will emit a gamma photon. Use the Reimann disc to take the 4 x 4 imaginary matrix of the photon. They tend to taste pretty good if you put it on 60% for 90 seconds or so.
- The banana emits positrons very slowly. Check your car to make sure the banana hasn't stolen your catalytic converter. Sneaky buggers.
